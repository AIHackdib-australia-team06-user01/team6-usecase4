ISM Control Assessment Tool

This module provides functionality to assess Information Security Manual (ISM) controls
against a set of Microsoft 365 DSC policies using Autogen & OpenAI's LLM capabilities.

The tool analyzes policy compliance and provides implementation status along with
relevant policy matches.

Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - UV package manager for dependency management
    - OpenAI API key set in environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY

Setup:
    1. Create virtual environment: uv venv
    2. Activate: source .venv/bin/activate
    3. Install deps: uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

Implementation Statuses:
    - Not Assessed: Control has not yet been evaluated or reviewed.
    - Effective: Control is fully implemented and meets its objective.
    - Alternate Control: A different control is implemented that meets or exceeds the original intent.
    - Not Implemented: Control is absent; no measures have been taken.
    - Partially Implemented: Some components are in place, but full compliance is not achieved.
    - Ineffective: Control exists but fails to meet its intended purpose or mitigate the associated risk.
    - Technically Unfeasible: Control cannot be implemented due to platform limitations or constraints.
    - No Visibility: Unable to verify implementation due to lack of evidence or access.
    - Not Applicable: Control is irrelevant to the systemâ€™s scope or architecture.

        You are an expert in ISM (Information Security Manual) and Essential Eight (E8) controls, specialising in evaluating whether assigned Microsoft 365 policies meet ISM control requirements and Essential Eight maturity expectations.

        Task: Assuming all non entraID controls are implemented and are satisfactory to ISM and E8, does this entraID report from powershell desired state configuration meet the following ISM control? Does the provided entraId desired state configuration report Effective, Partially Effective, or Ineffective in implementing the the provided Information Security Manual control? Use the latest ISM (September 2025) and ASD Blueprint for Secure Cloud as references.

        Information Security Manual (ISM) Control:
        Title: {ism_title}
        Description: {ism_description}

        Allowed Implementation Statuses:
        - Not Assessed: Control has not yet been evaluated or reviewed.
        - Effective: Control is fully implemented and meets its objective.
        - Alternate Control: A different control is implemented that meets or exceeds the original intent.
        - Not Implemented: Control is absent; no measures have been taken.
        - Partially Implemented: Some components are in place, but full compliance is not achieved.
        - Ineffective: Control exists but fails to meet its intended purpose or mitigate the associated risk.
        - Technically Unfeasible: Control cannot be implemented due to platform limitations or constraints.
        - No Visibility: Unable to verify implementation due to lack of evidence or access.
        - Not Applicable: Control is irrelevant to the systemâ€™s scope or architecture.

        EntraID Desired State Configuration policies:\n{self.policies}\n\n

        Assessment Criteria:
        1. If this ISM control is not related to entra, then assess the control as Effective and detail the relevant policies and controls and complete the task.
        2. If all non entra related controls are assumed effective, does the provided entra desired state configuration effectively address the provided ISM control requirements? Reference specific policy settings and control IDs.
        3. If all non entra related controls are assumed effective, is the implementation effective and actionable? Use ISM/E8 terminology and note any maturity level achieved.
        4. If all non entra related controls are assumed effective, are there any gaps or partial implementations? Suggest improvements if needed.
        5. Cite relevant policy titles and settings.

        Respond ONLY in this JSON format:
